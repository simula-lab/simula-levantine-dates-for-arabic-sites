A plugin that add options to use Arabic-Indic numerals, and Levantine months names in dates and times to Arabic WordPress sites.

== Description ==

A WordPress plugin developed by [Simula Lab Ltd](https://simulalab.org) that gives the admin(s) of an Arabic site the possibility to use Levantine Arabic Month Names in WordPress dates instead of (or in combination with) Modern Standard Arabic month names. It also allows for using Arabic-Indic numerals instead of Arabic numerals in WordPress dates and time.

It allows the site to:

- use Arabic-Indic numeral (١, ٢, ٣) instead of Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) in WordPress dates and times.
- use Levantine Arabic months names instead (شباط, آذار) of Modern Standard Arabic months names (فبراير, مارس) in WordPress dates.
- use a mix of Levantine and Standard Arabic months names (شباط/فبراير, آذار/مارس) or (فبراير/شباط, مارس/آذار) instead of Modern Standard Arabic months names.

After installing and activating the plugin, navigate to the "Settings" menu in the Admin Dashboard and select "Levantine Dates".

The plugin has no effect on non-Arabic sites.
